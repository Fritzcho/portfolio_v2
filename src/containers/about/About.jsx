          <p>
            I am a 22 year old interaction and design student at Ume√• University.
            Currently, I am studying my 6th term and aiming to learn as much as possible about
            every subject that comes across. I have a great interest and experiences in both UX
            design and frontend development. 
          </p>
          <h1 className='portfolio__about-header'>What I do</h1>
          <p>
            I currently work as a consultant and CDO at WeKnowIT. In my present roles
            I do a variety of work such as UX design, WP-development and internal work. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Below are listed some, but not all, of my skills. I do always try to
            branch out further and add more to these though! <br/>
